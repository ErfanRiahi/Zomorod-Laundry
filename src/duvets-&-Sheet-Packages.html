                <p>
                    Even though you might not clean your duvets daily, it is important to do it every once in a while
                    for hygiene reasons.
                    In order to prevent fungus, bacteria and dust mites, it is wise to have your duvet and pillows
                    cleaned at least twice a
                    year. This way, you can sleep well in a fresh, clean bed.

                    A lot of people prefer to wash their duvets themselves. The problem, however, is that your duvet
                    won’t always fit in
                    your washing machine or dryer. Plus, what often happens is that the machine breaks the lining, or
                    the wool becomes
                    matted. That is why it is smart to have your duvets cleaned professionally. At Dry Cleaning Ocean we
                    are experts at
                    cleaning your duvets and use professional products so your duvets are kept nice and fresh. Down
                    feather duvets stay
                    perfect and even get their bounce back. Woolen duvets should never be washed but have to be steamed.
                    The wool becomes
                    crimped and matted when you wash it, leaving you unable to use your duvet.

                <p>
                    It is difficult to wash bed sheets and table cloths yourself because they take up a lot of space and
                    usually do not fit
                    in your washing machine or dryer. Unfortunately, this often damages the bed sheets and table cloths.
                    You can prevent
                    this by having them professionally cleaned. Dry Cleaning Ocean would love to take this task off your
                    hands.
