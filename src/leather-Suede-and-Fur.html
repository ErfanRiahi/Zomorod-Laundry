                <p>
                    You need a specialist to clean leather, suede and fur. Cleaning leather is fairly challenging.
                    Washing it with water can
                    lead to a change in color, or it can dry out or crack the leather. This is something you want to
                    prevent. Suede is not
                    easy to clean either. It is a special type of leather that is generally made of the skin of sheep,
                    calves or goats. By
                    using chromium salts on the skin, the lovely result is the fabric we call suede. This makes suede
                    sensitive, which means
                    extra care should be taken whilst cleaning it, for example by ensuring it is cleaned at the optimal
                    temperature or by or
                    using a specialized cleaning product.
                    <br><br>
                    Lastly, we should talk about cleaning fur. Once again, we do not recommend you do this yourself.
                    Specialized methods and
                    products are required to clean fur, such as a specific type of detergent. That is why Dry Cleaning
                    Ocean would be more
                    than happy to help you clean your leather, suede and fur.
